# Image-Morph-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Models
A deep learning-based image morph detection project using VAE, Autoencoder, GAN, Vision Transformer, and Diffusion Models. Trained on a Kaggle human face dataset using Google Colab with GPU support. The models reconstruct face images and detect morphing through evaluation metrics like MSE, MAE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Cosine Similarity.
